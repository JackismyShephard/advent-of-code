* research optimized method for parsing numbers -- rust-lexical, atoi_simd, atoi_radix10
* research optimized method for parsing whitespace using memchr?
* research parallelization with rayon
* ndarray or grid or similar for 2D grids?
  * or grid_2d or pathfinding for 2D grids?
* nalgebra for matrix operations?
* polars for dataframes?
* use parametrization for benchmarks and for testing?
  * test frameworks: insta, proptest, quickcheck
  * how to do get the test coverage data? == tarpaulin. kcovyes?

* solve day01 part 1 using ndalegebra method for computing L1 norm
