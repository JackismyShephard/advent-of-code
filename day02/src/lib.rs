//! Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports
//!
//! Solution for Advent of Code 2024 Day 2.
//!
//! Part 1: Analyze reactor safety reports to determine which are safe.
//! A report is safe if levels are all increasing or all decreasing,
//! and adjacent levels differ by 1-3.
//!
//! Part 2: Problem Dampener - allows removing one level to make unsafe
//! reports safe. If removing any single level makes a report safe,
//! then the report is considered safe.
