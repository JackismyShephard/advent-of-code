# Day 4 Optimization Plan & Analysis

## Problem Overview

Word search puzzle: Find all occurrences of "XMAS" in a 139×140 character grid.

- 8 directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- Forwards and backwards
- Total operations: ~19,460 × 8 × 4 = ~622,720 character comparisons

## Current Status ✅

- **Implementation COMPLETE**: Clean, idiomatic Rust solution
- **All tests passing**: 18 for example, 2447 for real input
- **Code quality**: All pre-commit hooks pass
- **Architecture**: `Vec<Vec<char>>` with direction vectors, proper signed/unsigned handling

## Optimization Approaches Discussed

### 1. Parallelization with Rayon

- **Approach**: Parallelize grid traversal across rows or positions
- **Question**: Is 139×140 grid large enough to overcome thread overhead?
- **Implementation**: `grid.par_iter().enumerate().map(...)`

### 2. Fast Character Scanning with memchr

- **Approach**: Use `memchr` crate for faster character-by-character matching
- **Target**: Replace manual character comparisons in `check_direction()`
- **Benefit**: Optimized byte/character searching

### 3. Flat Array Design

- **Current**: `Vec<Vec<char>>` (natural indexing, multiple allocations)
- **Alternative**: `Vec<char>` with manual indexing `grid[row * width + col]`
- **Benefits**: Better cache locality, single allocation
- **Cost**: More complex indexing logic

### 4. Other Optimizations Considered

- **SIMD operations**: For 4-character "XMAS" pattern matching
- **Early termination**: Beyond first character mismatch (already implemented)
- **Direction vector optimization**: Reorganize for better cache patterns
- **aho-corasick**: Multiple pattern matching (overkill for single pattern)

## Optimization Priority Strategy

Following project's established approach:

1. **Algorithm Choice** (Most Impact)
   - Early termination ✅ (implemented)
   - Bounds checking optimization

2. **Data Structure Optimization**
   - Flat `Vec<char>` vs current `Vec<Vec<char>>`
   - Row-major access patterns

3. **Library Optimizations**
   - `memchr` for character scanning (most promising)
   - SIMD operations (limited benefit for 4-char pattern)

4. **Parallelization**
   - `rayon` for row/position parallelization
   - Likely unnecessary for this grid size

## Next Steps Plan

### Phase 1: Benchmarking (Pending)

```bash
cargo bench -p day04
```

- Add criterion benchmarks to establish baseline
- Component-level analysis (parsing vs searching vs counting)
- Identify actual bottlenecks

### Phase 2: Targeted Optimization (If Needed)

Based on benchmark results, consider implementing:

1. **memchr integration** (if character scanning is bottleneck)
2. **Flat array design** (if memory access is bottleneck)
3. **Rayon parallelization** (if total computation time is significant)

### Phase 3: Measurement & Validation

- Compare optimized vs baseline performance
- Ensure correctness maintained
- Look for consistent 1.2x+ improvements

## Key Philosophy

### "Measure first, optimize second"

- Start with clean, idiomatic code ✅
- Establish performance baseline
- Apply targeted optimizations only where measurements show benefit
- Grid size (139×140) may be too small for micro-optimizations to matter

## Performance Reality Check

- Small problem size (~19K positions)
- Focus should remain on clarity and correctness
- Many optimizations may provide negligible benefit
- **Algorithm choice beats micro-optimizations**
